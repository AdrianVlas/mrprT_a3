The size of each bank is fixed and equal to 64 Mbyte. Each bank is configured through
dedicated registers (see Section 37.5.6: NOR/PSRAM controller registers).

2.3.11 FMC NOR/PSRAM controller write protocol violation Description When an interrupted asynchronous or synchronous CPU read access to any NOR/PSRAM FMC bank is followed by an asynchronous write access to the same bank or to any other NOR/PSRAM FMC bank, this causes a write protocol violation. There is no functional issue but the FMC NOR/PSRAM controller write protocol is violated since the FMC_NWE signal is de-asserted at the same time as the Chip select (FMC_NEx). Workaround None.

2.3.12 FMC NOR/PSRAM controller bank switch with different  BUSTURN durations Description The system hangs when the FMC NOR/PSRAM memory controller switches between two banks and the following conditions are met: 1. One NOR/PSRAM bank is configured in synchronous mode and the BUSTURN bits in FMC_BTRx/FMC_BTWx register are set to a nonzero value. 2. Another NOR/PSRAM bank is configured in asynchronous multiplexed mode and BUSTURN bits are set to 0. 3. FMC clock divide ratio (CLKDIV) is higher or equal to 4 HCLK periods. 4. A single read transaction from the bank operating in synchronous mode is followed by any transaction in another bank operating in asynchronous multiplexed mode. Workaround If several NOR/PSRAM banks are used, the BUSTURN duration configured for each bank must be set to a nonzero value. 

Dear sirs in STM32F42xx and STM32F43x Errata sheet i have found chapter 2.3.11 FMC NOR/PSRAM controller write protocol violation.
I read "When an interrupted asynchronous or synchronous CPU read access to any NOR/PSRAM FMC bank is followed by an asynchronous write access to the same bank or to any other NOR/PSRAM FMC bank, this causes a write protocol violation.
There is no functional issue but the FMC NOR/PSRAM controller write protocol is violated since the FMC_NWE signal is de-asserted at the same time as the Chip select (FMC_NEx)."

In pictures below is showed that CPU can't directly acces on external memory.
CPU has access to AHB3. And  AHB3 access to FMC.

It is make several qustions.
1)Guess AHB3 (it's may be CPU) begin asynchronous or synchronous read access to any NOR/PSRAM FMC bank. How AHB3(CPU) can interrupt asynchronous or synchronous read access to any NOR/PSRAM FMC bank?

2)When AHB3 address external memory it always multiplexed read/write operation.
So, it always read access to any bank is followed by an asynchronous write access to the same bank or to any other NOR/PSRAM FMC bank.
So, it causes a write protocol violation frequently, isn't it?

3)What does it mean " no functional issue"?

4)"the FMC_NWE signal is de-asserted at the same time as the Chip select (FMC_NEx)." 
In RM0090 in figures 4xx prestnt waveforms that showing read/write access.

Can you provide actual read/write waveforms?
